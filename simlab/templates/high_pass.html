                    <p>The Passive High Pass Filter is the exact opposite to the low pass filter. This filter has no output voltage from DC (0Hz), up to a specified cut-off frequency ( ƒc ) point. This lower cut-off frequency point is 70.7% or -3dB (dB = -20log VOUT/VIN) of the voltage gain allowed to pass.
                    </p>
                    <p>The frequency range “below” this cut-off point ƒc is generally known as the Stop Band while the frequency range “above” this cut-off point is generally known as the Pass Band.
                    </p>
                    <p>The cut-off frequency, corner frequency or -3dB point of a high pass filter can be found using the standard formula of: ƒc = 1/(2πRC). The phase angle of the resulting output signal at ƒc is +45o. Generally, the high pass filter is less distorting than its equivalent low pass filter due to the higher operating frequencies.

                    A very common application of this type of passive filter, is in audio amplifiers as a coupling capacitor between two audio amplifier stages and in speaker systems to direct the higher frequency signals to the smaller “tweeter” type speakers while blocking the lower bass signals or are also used as filters to reduce any low frequency noise or “rumble” type distortion. When used like this in audio applications the high pass filter is sometimes called a “low-cut”, or “bass cut” filter.
                    </p>
                    <p>The output voltage Vout depends upon the time constant and the frequency of the input signal as seen previously. With an AC sinusoidal signal applied to the circuit it behaves as a simple 1st Order high pass filter. But if we change the input signal to that of a “square wave” shaped signal that has an almost vertical step input, the response of the circuit changes dramatically and produces a circuit known commonly as an Differentiator.</p>
