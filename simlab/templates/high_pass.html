                <p>
                    <p>AC bridges are the circuits that are used for the measurement of electrical quantities such as inductance, capacitance, resistance. 
                        Along with these an ac bridge allows us to measure storage factor, loss factor, dissipation factor etc. 
                        AC bridges operate with only AC signal. They are also used to provide phase shifting and a feedback path to oscillator circuits.
                    </p>
                    <p>Bridge circuits are extensively used for measuring values of electrical components such as R, C and L. The construction of the bridges 
                        is very simple. The bridge has four arms, one AC supply source and the balance detector. 
                        It works on the principle that the balance ratio of the impedances will give the balance condition to the circuit which 
                        is determined by the null detector. If the voltage difference between the two nodes of the detector is zero, then the 
                        bridge is said to be in a balanced condition. No current flows through the detector in such a state.
                    </p>
                    <p>Wheatstone bridge is an AC Bridge with only purely resistive components and is used in the measurement of
                        medium resistances. Wheatstone bridge has been in use longer than almost any electrical measuring instrument. 
                        It is still an accurate and reliable instrument and is extensively used in industry.</p>
                    <p>The Wheatstone bridge is an instrument for making comparison instruments and
                        operates upon a null indication principle. This means the indication is
                        independent of the calibration of the null indicating instrument or any of its
                        characteristics. For this reason, very high degrees of accuracy can be
                        achieved using Wheatstone bridge. Accuracy of 0.1% is quite common with
                        a Wheatstone bridge as opposed to accuracies of 3% to 5% with ordinary
                        ohmmeter for measurement of medium resistances.</p>

                    </center>
                    <p>The Wheatstone bridge is also well-suited for the measurement of small changes of 
                        a resistance and, therefore, is also suitable to measure the resistance change in a strain gauge.
                        It is commonly known that the strain gauge transforms strain applied to it
                        into a proportional change of resistance.</p> 
                    <p>The basic circuit of a Wheatstone bridge consists of four resistive arms, consisting of resistances R1, R2, R3 and R4 together with a 
                        source of emf (a battery) and a null detector (a sensitive voltmeter in our case). With one resistance (R1 = Rx) unknown, and with two variable
                        arms (R2 and R3), we can find out the value of unknown resistance (Rx). Due to the bridge balancing equation derived below
                        which involves four quantities, we can always find the unknown when the other three quantities are known.

                <p>
                    <p>1) Select the value set for resistance from the dropdown menu in blue dashboard. Choose Set-1.</p>
                    <p>2) Now, Rx is set to some unknown constant. Now, vary the values of R2 and R3 using the corresponding slider inputs
                        until the bridge is balanced.
                    </p>
                    <p>3) For obtaining the balance, one needs to vary values of R2 and R3 in such a way that the detector
                        voltage becomes less than 5 miilivolt. As soon as, detector voltage goes below 5 millivolt, a balance
                        is obtained.
                    </p>
                    <p>4) In the balanced bridge condition, the calculate Rx button will become active. Click on it to find the
                        value of Rx (system calculated, not actual value of Rx) obtained by using the parameters of the balanced bridge. 
                        You can hide it using the Hide button beside it.
                    </p>
                    <p>5) Click on See Calculated Rx to see the calculated value of the unknown parameter Rx in the sidebar. Note, 
                        that this is not an observation table. The present readings will not be stored here after you change anything in the bridge.
                    </p>
                    <p>6) Now, select Set-2 as the new value for Rx and redo steps 1 to 5. Note that readings of previous Rx values
                        (from previously selected sets of Rx) will not be stored anywhere. The whole page including the sidebar 
                        resets to default state (with no record of previous readings) when a different set for Rx value is selected.
                    </p>
                    <p>7) Keep verifying the results obtained by solving the bridge yourself after each cycle (steps 1 to 5).</p>
                    <p>8) The three sets of values used are: 
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rx --> [Set-1: 60 ohm;   Set-2: 370 ohm;   Set-3: 730 ohm].
                    </p>
                    <p>9) Compare these values with the calculated values of Rx obtained during the experiment. If the
                        actual values match the readings obtained (or the difference lies within error tolerance limits) 
                        then the the results are verified.
